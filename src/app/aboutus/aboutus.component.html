              <p>We are the women of Waze. We come from a rural, agricultural area called Wazapur in Raigad District,
                sixty
                kilometers away from the sprawling city of Mumbai in India.
              </p>
              <p>Ours is a story of grit and determination – a journey from diffidence and dependence to confidence and
                self-empowerment. We strongly believe that economic independence is the first step towards self-
                reliance
                and
                empowerment. Although we have come a long way from where we started, we believe that we have the
                confidence
                and skills to achieve much more.</p>

              <p>The WEP (Women Empowerment Program) in Wazapur was started in 2007 by an enthusiastic group of
                volunteers
                from TCS, one of India’s leading software services provider. This corporate social responsibility
                group,
                call
                themselves “Maitree” meaning friendship. They extended a warm hand of friendship to us and led us
                through
                our
                journey of progress.</p>

              <p>The long term objective was to make us financially independent. The question was how? After putting
                much
                thought into this, we finally embarked on our artistic journey of creating handicraft products like
                jute
                bags. We spread the word around, and by the end of one year, we were a group of twenty women, even from
                neighboring villages, with their skills honed in embroidery, stitching and craftwork. We received a
                great
                deal of help and support from Women’s India Trust. </p>
              <p>It was now time to go a step ahead, and establish ourselves in a place which could convert our art
                into
                much
                needed income. That saw the birth of Gram Vikas Abhiyaan Kendra established by TCS Maitree.</p>

                enthusiasm
                doesn’t stop there. We are extending our products to include other household items like cushion covers,
